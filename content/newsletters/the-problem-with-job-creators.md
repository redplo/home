A common argument against implementing a wealth tax or closing tax loopholes is that the rich are job creators and if we didn't bend over backwards to accommodate them they might leave taking all the jobs they offer with them.

Of course, it can be easily shown that such line of argument amounts to absurdity. As long as the business is filling a useful niche there is profit to be made. All that would happen if the original business owner left is be that the business would pass to a different owner who is willing to accept the lower profit margin.

While it's easily to There is a more fundamental issue that warrants discussion. The question we need to ask is how we ended up in a scenario where jobs are handed out by a small number of people who are able to hold the rest of us hostage to their whims.

To find the answer we'll first need to take a look at how jobs are created in our society. There are two primary sources of jobs knowns as public and private sectors.

Public sector jobs are offered by the government and largely fill functions needed to make our society function. Some examples of public sector jobs include education, healthcare, sanitation. Many of these jobs are what we see being referred to as essential work during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the goal of jobs created by the private sector is to generate wealth for the business owners. Many of these jobs don't have any clear benefit to the society at large, and some are actively harmful. For example, fossil fuel lobbyists are actively facilitating the destruction of our environment, and we would all be better off without them.

Most jobs in Canada are offered by the private sector, and exist for the sole purpose of generating wealth for the business owning class. The value generated through the labour of the workers is appropriated by the business owners with the workers being paid a small portion of the value in form of wages.

It's easy to see how this system resulted in massive wealth concentration with a mere [hundred people having accumulated more wealth than bottom 6 million families combined](https://north99.org/2019/12/20/richest-100-canadians-have-more-wealth-than-bottom-6-million-families-combined-thats-a-serious-problem/) by exploiting the labour of the working class.

We can now arrive the core problem with the idea of job creators. Having affluent individuals being in charge of handing out jobs results in work being largely allocated towards increasing the wealth of these individuals as opposed to the needs of the society at large.
